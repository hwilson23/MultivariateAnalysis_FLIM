# Multi-variate Analysis for FLIM 

Determination of Coefficient of Variation in complex FLIM datasets under different imaging conditions

## Results

- * Large Cov is strongly associated with long-lifetime FLIM data *

## Goals

- Compare two  distinct lifetime distributions over time/ days
- Compare many distinct lifetimes over singleday/ time-lapse
- Compare live changes using a quencher
  - Translate result into biexponential dataset and biological samples
  - Examine acqusition parameters / Test pile-up correction
  - Examine solutions both hardware and software  

## Todo List

- Make R-project
- Folder-based separation for project milestones (update .gitignore)
- Examine the cause for segregation in High CCV values
- Refactor CCV to tau-mean
